# Java 2D Plateformer

![](assets/demo.gif)

This is a 2D Plateformer Game I made a few years ago using Java's standard libraries.

You can try it yourself by cloning / downloading the repository. On windows you can run the bat file, otherwise search for the JAR in src/.

This is a project I made as a beginner. It is far from being perfect and would need to be refactored (general logic, optmization, naming & conventions, usage of an IDE for better structure, ...)

Last tested version : Java 1.8.0_191
